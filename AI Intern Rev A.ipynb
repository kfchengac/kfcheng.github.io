    "# AI Scopes — ClearCF (Sales) + Agent\n",
    "\n",
    "> Working note: the **sales mechanism** we’re designing now is for **ClearCF.com** (not COLLIDE). The **agent scope** can be shared/reused across companies if we keep it modular.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Catch-up Agenda (30–45 min)\n",
    "1. Confirm ClearCF context (offer, ICP, current funnel)\n",
    "2. Sales mechanism scope (what the AI does / does not do)\n",
    "3. Agent scope (capabilities, tools, guardrails)\n",
    "4. Data + integrations + compliance constraints\n",
    "5. Next deliverables + timeline\n",
    "\n",
    "> Current context captured (from your answers): ClearCF provides end-to-end financial advisory to craft tailored capital solutions for deeptech + energy transition ventures/projects, incl. fundraising, divestments, and fund manager capital raising.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Buyer personas: pioneers/founders, growth ventures, shareholders/management teams, and fund managers in deep tech / cleantech / renewables / sustainable infrastructure. Core pain: strategize, position, and secure required capital.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Current CTAs: “Get in touch” + newsletter subscription (“Clear Insights”).\n",
    "\n",
    "> Channels mentioned: LinkedIn + email + newsletter. (Priority for next 30 days TBD.)\n",
    "\n",
    "> Operations (confirmed/assumed): shared inbound inbox at contact@clearcf.com; no scheduling link confirmed yet.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Service lines (confirmed): Fundraising, Divestment, Fund Manager Capital Raising. Ownership/routing rules TBD.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Compliance note: Clear is **not licensed/regulated by AFM** (per site language). Content must remain informational and **not financial/investment/legal advice**. Privacy policy exists → design for GDPR/PII hygiene.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1) Sales Mechanism (ClearCF.com) — Scope Definition\n",
    "**Goal:** optimize for (choose one for v1)\n",
    "- Qualified intro call booked with the right partner, OR\n",
    "- Qualified inbound “capital needs” brief submitted, OR\n",
    "- High-quality deal flow in CRM (with next actions)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Primary users:** (choose) partners/founders, BD/sales, marketing\n",
    "\n",
    "**Target customer / ICP:**\n",
    "- Sectors: deep tech, cleantech, renewables, sustainable infrastructure\n",
    "- Entities: ventures/projects, shareholders/management teams, fund managers\n",
    "- Need: capital strategy + execution support (fundraising/divestment/fundraising for funds)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Channels in scope:** website contact form / inbound email / LinkedIn inbound & outbound / newsletter\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sales workflow (happy path):**\n",
    "- Capture lead → qualify → route (venture/project vs fund manager) → schedule intro → create brief → handoff to partner\n",
    "\n",
    "**AI responsibilities (v1-friendly):**\n",
    "- Triage inbound (“Get in touch” submissions + emails)\n",
    "- Ask structured qualification questions and summarize into a 1-page brief\n",
    "- Classify lead type (venture/project vs fund manager) + likely service line\n",
    "- Draft compliant follow-ups (no advice; no promises)\n",
    "- Propose next step (call scheduling link if available; otherwise propose time windows)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Out of scope (explicitly for v1):**\n",
    "- Giving investment recommendations, valuation opinions, or fundraising guarantees\n",
    "- Sending emails/DMs without human approval (start with approval-first)\n",
    "- Any language implying regulated financial advisory\n",
    "\n",
    "**Inputs / data sources:** website copy, service pages, case studies, team bios, FAQs, prior proposals/templates, email threads (optional), CRM notes (optional)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Outputs:** lead summary, qualification score, routing decision, draft reply, CRM/update payload\n",
    "\n",
    "**Success metrics:** reply-to-lead time, % leads with complete brief, meeting booked rate, partner time saved\n",
    "\n",
    "**Integrations (desired):** email inbox, calendar/scheduling, CRM (optional for v1)\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2) Agent Scope (Reusable) — What “Agent” Means Here\n",
    "**Agent tasks:** plan → execute → report for a single lead/opportunity\n",
    "- Gather info from conversation + knowledge base\n",
    "- Decide next step (within guardrails)\n",
    "- Produce drafts + structured updates (CRM-ready JSON later if needed)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tooling:** knowledge base retrieval, email draft, calendar link insertion (if available), CRM read/write (later)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Autonomy level (recommended for v1):** Level 1 (drafts + human approval)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Memory:** store only what’s necessary (lead profile + conversation summary); define retention window\n",
    "\n",
    "**Guardrails:**\n",
    "- Must include “informational only / not advice” phrasing where appropriate\n",
    "- No regulated-service claims; no promises of funding outcomes\n",
    "- Escalate to human for anything resembling advice, pricing/terms, or sensitive requests\n",
    "- Minimize PII; follow GDPR principles\n",
    "\n",
    "## Decisions to Make in This Catch-up\n",
    "- Pick ClearCF v1 conversion event: book intro call vs structured brief submission\n",
    "- Define channel priority for next 30 days (LinkedIn vs inbound email vs website)\n",
    "- Confirm tools stack (inbox, calendar, CRM)\n",
    "- Confirm what we can store (PII + retention)\n",
    "- Define routing rules for the 3 service lines (owner mapping)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Quick Questions (what’s still unknown)\n",
    "1. For v1, do you want the AI to route to a **call** (Calendly-style) or to a **written brief** first?\n",
    "2. Who will receive routed leads (one inbox? multiple partners?)\n",
    "3. Any no-go topics/claims beyond “not advice” (e.g., performance, investor access)?"

    "## ClearCF Sales Mechanism — V1 Proposal (Practical Build Spec)\n",
    "\n",
    "> This is a starting point for implementation. Assumes **approval-first** messaging and strict “not advice” guardrails.\n",
    "\n",
    "### A) Inbound Lead Triage (Website + Email)\n",
    "**Trigger:** new inbound message (contact form submission or inbound email).\n",
    "**Agent outputs:**\n",
    "- Lead type classification: `venture/project` vs `fund manager`\n",
    "- Service line classification: `fundraising` | `divestment` | `fund manager capital raising`\n",
    "- Capital need summary (stage, amount range if provided, geography, timeline)\n",
    "- Qualification checklist completion (missing fields flagged)\n",
    "- Draft reply (compliant, helpful, asks 3–6 targeted questions)\n",
    "- Routing recommendation (who should pick it up)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Minimum questions (suggested):**\n",
    "1) Are you a venture/project team or a fund manager?\n",
    "2) Sector + geography\n",
    "3) Current stage (idea / pre-seed / seed / Series A+ / project finance / infra)\n",
    "4) Capital objective (raise, refinance, divestment, fundraise for fund)\n",
    "5) Target timeline + urgency\n",
    "6) What materials exist (deck, data room, financial model)?\n",
    "\n",
    "### B) Outbound (LinkedIn + Email) — Optional for V1\n",
    "**Trigger:** a partner provides an ICP list (companies/funds) or the agent identifies targets from an approved list.\n",
    "**Agent outputs:**\n",
    "- 3-message LinkedIn sequence + 2-email sequence (all drafts)\n",
    "- Personalization points pulled from public info supplied by humans (avoid scraping unless explicitly allowed)\n",
    "- Logging: each outreach attempt + status\n",
    "\n",
    "### C) Compliance / Safety Guardrails (Non-negotiable)\n",
    "- Always avoid: investment recommendations, promises of funding, pricing/terms commitments\n",
    "- Use compliant phrasing: “informational only; not financial/investment/legal advice” where needed\n",
    "- If user asks for advice: provide general process info + escalate to human\n",
    "- PII minimization: store only what’s needed; define retention (e.g., 30/90 days)\n",
    "\n",
    "### D) Autonomy & Approvals\n",
    "- Default: agent drafts replies + partner approves before sending\n",
    "- Optional later: auto-send only for low-risk templates (e.g., request-for-more-info)\n",
    "\n",
    "### E) Tooling (Choose 1 path)\n",
    "**Path 1 (fastest):** email-only + shared inbox + calendar link (if/when available)\n",
    "- Inputs: shared inbox (confirmed: contact@clearcf.com)\n",
    "- If no scheduling link: propose 2–3 time windows and ask for availability, then handoff to human to confirm\n",
    "- Output: draft emails + routing notes\n",
    "\n",
    "**Path 2 (more scalable):** add lightweight CRM\n",
    "- Track lead status, owner, next action, timestamps\n",
    "- Enables reporting on time-to-response + pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "### Current Answers + Remaining Unknowns\n",
    "- Preferred first step: current website behavior is **“Get in touch”** (inbound message first). Whether ClearCF wants **call-first** vs **brief-first** is still an internal product decision (not specified yet).\n",
    "- Shared inbox: **Yes** (contact@clearcf.com).\n",
    "- Scheduling link: **Not available / not confirmed** today (v1 can run without it).\n",
    "- Service lines (confirmed):\n",
    "  - Fundraising (incl. positioning, investor engagement, transaction support; may include debt/hybrid financing and non-dilutive EU funding support)\n",
    "  - Divestment (end-to-end divestment process support)\n",
    "  - Fund Manager Capital Raising (positioning + investor network activation for funds)\n",
    "- Ownership: specific person/team per service line **not defined yet** (v1 can route to shared inbox + tags until owners are set).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Open Questions (need your answers)\n",
    "1) For v1, should the agent push for a call ASAP, or collect a structured brief first?\n",
    "2) If call-first: do you want to create a scheduling link (Calendly) or keep it manual?\n",
    "3) Who owns each service line (names or roles), and what is the fallback if unclear?"
